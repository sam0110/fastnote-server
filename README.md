# FastNote Server

An extremely simple backend for a note-taking app. Built with FastAPI.

## Note

This API lacks authentication, users, and input validation (besides FastAPI's built-in validation). It was built for testing frontend frameworks for learning purposes.

<mark>Do not use this for any serious note-taking</mark>
